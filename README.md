# Prerequisite

- sass is installed
- Modules are installed using ``npm install``
- You have the following tools installed globally:
  - ``npm install -g selenium-webdriver``

# Available tasks

Tasks are stored as NPM Scripts.

They should be used over installing software with npm install -g.

It avoids getting conflicts with stations that have a lot of npm packages installed

You can run them with npm run A_SCRIPT_NAME.

Here's a few commands more can be found in the package.json.

```bash

# Compile assets
